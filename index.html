			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p >I'm an aspiring software engineer that is always eager to learn<br>
			new things and work hard to achieve my goals. I really enjoy working<br>
			with different systems and programs using them to create software<br>
			of my own and to see what I am capable of.Programming is a big passion<br>
			of mine and has continously peeked my interest since learning my first<br>
			"Hello World".</p>
			
			<p>I have worked with a lot of different languages including Java, Python,<br>
			C# and C++. Using these languages I have created programs covering the<br>
			fundamental concepts in programming.I think I like developing video game<br>
			development using game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine creating<br>
			small games that cover a lot of the fundamental concepts in video game<br>
			development</p>
			
			<p>Aside from my love for everything computers I am really fond of the<br>
			outdoors enjoying activities like hiking and sports volley ball. I also find animals<br>
			very interesting and like to care for them. From feeding, birds<br>
			and small fishes to caring for my "Perry" Shawty and my beautiful pets<br>
			and also I am an introvert that is so not introverted.</p>
